epoch: best_mean
# which epoch to evaluate the model on. None means the final epoch.
# 'best_sumsq' means the epoch meeting the following criteria:
# (1) it has the minimum loss for at least one set evaluated during training
# (2) if best_sumsq it minimizes the sumsq differences between the average loss
#     at that epoch compared to other epochs meeting criterion (1)
# 'best_mean' means the epoch that has lowest mean loss on dev sets
