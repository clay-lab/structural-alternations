# if an arg is a list of strings, then a list of sentences where each value of arg is replaced for arg
# is used
# if multiple args are manually specified, then all possible combinations will be generated
# if an arg is a number n, then the list of the n most predicted words is automatically chosen for replacement
# once all other words in the sentence have been filled in manually
